What will you find in the folders ? Good question, let me help you.
1. - In the HuntingGame folder, there is a simple game written in Java, where you can have 2 players compete against each other in a hunters versus prey game. The prey (Player 1) has to survive and the hunters (Player 2) has to surround the prey ( block every possible move ). If the prey surives until the end they win. On the other hand if the hunters sourround the prey, they win. Simple as that.
2. - In the Snake folder you will find the famous Snake game written by Me in Java. Not the best implementation of this masterpiece, but I tried my best. I tried to play around with random generated walls and works, almost every time.
3. - In the atmosphere folder you will find one my oldest projects, a simulation where you have a distant world, where plants live and behave according to some rules. The inputs arrive from input files and the simulation runs until every plant dies out.
